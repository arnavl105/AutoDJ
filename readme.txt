AutoDJ is a soundcloud player and queue written around the event based animation class. It is run by simply running it in python.
The external modules needed for this project are soundcloud, mp3play and PIL. I've included the installations for these modules
in the project folder, but all of these can also be installed through easy_install or pip(the included PIL setup is windows only).
